# This website is not real, it is practice

- The website is for a fake future website that I hope to one day make for my sister. If I can I want to make it function as a site to request commisons for her art and have it where the buyer can get it sent to them. I am still learning coding so this will take a while.

- I used six Html files to make the website itself
    - index.html *The Main Page*
    - example.html *Examples of Previous Commisions*
    - about.html *About the main artist and website creator*
    - form.html *The page that says the request was submited*
    - submit.html *The page that says the review was submited*

- I used one Css file, Sematic Ui, Awesome Font, and Bootstrap
    - colors-1.css *obvioulsy for font and color changes, also some size fixing*

- Lastly I added in my own placeholder photos for where real images made by the artist could be placed.
