# This website is not real, it is practice

- The website is for a fake future website that I hope to one day make for my sister. If I can I want to make it function as a site to request commisons for her art and have it where the buyer can get it sent to them. I am still learning coding so this will take a while.

- I used six Html files to make the website itself
